@mainpage Welcome

This documentation describes the Python API usage for the Azure Kinect Sensor
SDK.

For details about the Azure Kinect DK hardware and for more information about
getting started with development please see https://azure.com/kinect.

@section api_languages API Languages
The Azure Kinect Sensor SDK is primarily a C API. This documentation covers the
Python wrapper extension to the API. For the most detailed documentation of API
behavior, see the documentation for the C functions that the Python classes
wrap.

@section python_examples Examples
Refer to the Examples for example Python code to effectively use the Python
API. Once the Python API package is installed, a simple "import k4a" will
give you access to all the classes and enums used in the API.

@example the_basics.py
@example image_transformations.py
@example simple_viewer.py
