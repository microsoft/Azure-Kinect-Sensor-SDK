         - Timestamps are recorded by the device and represent the mid-point of
            exposure. They may be used for relative comparison, but their 
            absolute value has no defined meaning.
         - If the Image is invalid or if no timestamp was set for the image,
            this value will be 0. It is also possible for a 0 value to be a
            valid timestamp originating from the beginning of a recording or

    <td> system_timestamp_nsec </td>
    <td> int </td>
    <td> R/W </td>
    <td> The device timestamp in nanoseconds.
         - The system timestamp is a high performance and increasing clock 
            (from boot). The timestamp represents the time immediately after 
            the image buffer was read by the host PC.
         - Timestamps are recorded by the host. They may be used for relative
            comparision, as they are relative to the corresponding system 
            clock. The absolute value is a monotonic count from an arbitrary 
            point in the past.
         - The system timestamp is captured at the moment host PC finishes 
            receiving the image.
         - On Linux the system timestamp is read from 
            clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC), which measures realtime and is not
            impacted by adjustments to the system clock. It starts from an 
            arbitrary point in the past. On Windows the system timestamp is 
            read from QueryPerformanceCounter(). It also measures realtime and
            is not impacted by adjustments to the system clock. It also starts
            from an arbitrary point in the past.
         - If the Image is invalid or if no timestamp was set for the image,
            this value will be 0. It is also possible for a 0 value to be a
            valid timestamp originating from the beginning of a recording or
            the start of streaming.

         - If the Image is invalid or if no white balance was set for the image,
            this value will be 0. If the image is read from the device and this
            value is 0, this indicates the ISO speed was not available or an
            error occurred. An ISO of 0 is considered invalid.

    @remarks 
    - An Image manages an image buffer and associated metadata.
    
    @remarks 
    - Do not use the Image() constructor to get an Image instance. It
        will return an object that does not have a handle to the image
        resources held by the SDK. Instead, use the create() function.

    @remarks 
    - The memory associated with the image buffer in an Image may have been
    allocated by the Azure Kinect APIs or by the application. If the 
    Image was created by an Azure Kinect API, its memory will be freed when all
    references to the Image are released. All images retrieved directly from a
    device will have been created by the API. An application can create an
    Image using memory that it has allocated using create_from_ndarray() and
    passing an numpy ndarray with a pre-allocated memory. In both cases, the
    memory is released when the all references to the Image object are
    released, either explicitly with del or it goes out of scope. Users do not
    need to worry about memory allocation and deallocation other than the
    normal rules for Python objects.

    @remarks
    - An image has a number of metadata properties that can be set or 
    retrieved. Not all properties are applicable to images of all types. 
    See the documentation for the individual properties for more information on
    their applicability and meaning.

    @remarks
    - Images may be of one of the standard EImageFormat formats, or may be of 
    format EImageFormat.CUSTOM. The format defines how the underlying image 
    buffer should be interpreted.

    @remarks
    - Images from a device are retrieved through a Capture object returned by 
    Device.get_capture().

    @remarks
    - Images stored in a capture are referenced by the capture until they are
    replaced or the capture is destroyed.

    @remarks 
    - An Image object may be copied or deep copied. A shallow copy
        shares the same data as the original, and any changes in one will
        affect the other. A deep copy does not share any resources with the
        original, and changes in one will not affect the other. In both shallow
        and deep copies, deleting one will have no effects on the other.

        @remarks
        - For most image formats, the function will allocate an image buffer of
            size @p height_pixels * @p stride_bytes. Buffers with image format
            of EImageFormat.COLOR_NV12 will allocate an additional

            represent an image that has a non-deterministic stride, use 
            create_from_ndarray().

        @remarks
        - The numpy ndarray keeps a record of the per-dimension stride in bytes
            to get to the next sample in the same dimension. The definition of
            stride in the Azure Kinect SDK is the number of bytes to get to the
            next sample in the row, so it only has one stride. As such, the
            stride that is used to pass to the SDK is the first stride in the
            ndarray. In cases where the geometry of the ndarray does not map
            well to this scheme, the user can use the optional
            @p stride_bytes_custom to pass in a custom stride to use.

        @remarks
        - Users can pass in their own size, width, height, and stride to use in
            cases where the ndarray shape and size metadata does not map well
            to the predefined EImageFormat types. They supercede any of the
            corresponding metadata in the ndarray.

        @remarks
        - If an error occurs, then None is returned.
